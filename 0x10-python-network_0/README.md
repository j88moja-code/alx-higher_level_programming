* [0-body_size.sh]() - a Bash script that takes in a URL, sends a request to that URL, and displays the size of the body of the response

    * The size must be displayed in bytes
    * You have to use ``curl``

* [1-body.sh]() -  a Bash script that takes in a URL, sends a ``GET`` request to the URL, and displays the body of the response

    * Display only body of a ``200`` status code response
    * You have to use ``curl``

* [2-delete.sh]() - a Bash script that sends a ``DELETE`` request to the URL passed as the first argument and displays the body of the response

    * You have to use ``curl``

* [3-methods.sh]() - a Bash script that takes in a URL and displays all HTTP methods the server will accept.

    * You have to use ``curl``

* [4-header.sh]() - a Bash script that takes in a URL as an argument, sends a GET request to the URL, and displays the body of the response

    * A header variable ``X-School-User-Id`` must be sent with the value ``98``
    * You have to use ``curl``

* [5-post_params.sh]() - a Bash script that takes in a URL, sends a ``POST`` request to the passed URL, and displays the body of the response

    * A variable ``email`` must be sent with the value ``test@gmail.com``
    * A variable ``subject`` must be sent with the value ``I will always be here for PLD``
    * You have to use ``curl``

Technical interview preparation
* [6-peak.py]() [6-peak.txt]() -  a function that finds a peak in a list of unsorted integers.

    * Prototype: ``def find_peak(list_of_integers)``:
    * You are not allowed to import any module
    * Your algorithm must have the lowest complexity (hint: you don’t need to go through all numbers to find a peak)
    * ``6-peak.py``  must contain the function
    * ``6-peak.txt`` must contain the complexity of your algorithm: O(log(n)), O(n), O(nlog(n)) or O(n2)
    * Note: there may be more than one peak in the list
